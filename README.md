# SafeWalk: LiDAR-Powered Object Detection for Enhanced Mobility

SafeWalk is an innovative iOS application designed to improve mobility and safety for users by leveraging advanced LiDAR technology and real-time object detection. Built with SwiftUI and AVFoundation, this app transforms your iOS device into a powerful tool for spatial awareness and obstacle avoidance.

## Key Features:
- 🔍 Real-time LiDAR depth sensing
- 🚶‍♂️ Accurate distance measurement to nearby objects
- ⚠️ Proximity alerts for close obstacles
- 📱 Intuitive SwiftUI interface
- 🔄 Smooth camera integration

## Technology Stack:
- Swift 5.5+
- SwiftUI
- AVFoundation
- Core ML (planned for future object recognition)

SafeWalk is perfect for individuals with visual impairments, those navigating in low-visibility conditions, or anyone looking to enhance their spatial awareness in unfamiliar environments. Join us in making the world more accessible, one step at a time!

## Current Status:
In active development. Contributors and feedback welcome!
